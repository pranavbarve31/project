Objective:
  The main goal was to create a robust system that could efficiently detect and count objects in video footage. This is particularly useful for applications such as monitoring traffic flow in real-time or           analyzing crowd densities at events.

Setup and Libraries:
  I started by setting up my environment. Since I was working on Google Colab, I leveraged its powerful GPU capabilities. I used several libraries, including ultralytics for the YOLOv8 model, supervision for       video frame annotation, and NumPy for numerical operations.

Model Initialization:
  I used the pre-trained YOLOv8 model, which I loaded and fused for optimized performance. YOLOv8 is known for its speed and accuracy, making it ideal for real-time object detection tasks.

Data Preparation:
  The source video, which in this case was a traffic video, was loaded from Google Drive. I used a frame generator to read the video frame by frame, ensuring that the system could handle videos of varying lengths   and resolutions.

Object Detection:
  For each frame, the YOLOv8 model was used to detect objects. The detections were filtered to include only selected classes, such as cars, trucks, and pedestrians, which are relevant for traffic analysis.

Tracking and Annotation:
  I implemented a ByteTrack tracker to keep track of the detected objects across frames. This is crucial for accurately counting objects, as it distinguishes between individual instances.
  Various annotators from the supervision library were used to draw bounding boxes around detected objects, label them, and trace their movement across frames.

Line Zone for Counting:
  A virtual line was drawn across the frame, and the system was set to count objects as they crossed this line. This feature is particularly useful for traffic monitoring, as it helps in counting vehicles passing   through a certain point.

Video Processing and Output:
  The entire video was processed frame by frame, applying the detection, tracking, and annotation logic. The output was a new video with all the detected objects annotated and counted, which was saved for further   analysis.
